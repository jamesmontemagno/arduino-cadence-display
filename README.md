# My Cadence for Arduino

This is an open source project to connect to popular cadence sensors for indoor cycling and display the current cadence in realtime.  Looking for a free cadence display for iOS & Android? Checkout [My Cadence for iOS & Android](https://mycadence.app).

Inspired & code forked from https://github.com/snowzach/echbt, which is an awesome way of dislaying data from an Echelon bike.

## Setup

1. Install [Arduino Studio](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Open .ino in Arduino Studio
3. Add ESP32 Device - [Follow these steps](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp32/quick_start.html)
4. Select Wifi 32 from Tools -> Board -> Heltec
5. Add ESP32 Library - [Follow these steps](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32)
6. Add ESP32 BLE Arduino Library - https://github.com/nkolban/ESP32_BLE_Arduino
7. Deploy to device!

The app will automatically scan for cadence sensors for 10 seconds. If it finds a single sensor it will automatically connect and start reporting data! If there are multiple sensors detected you can pick on from the list.
